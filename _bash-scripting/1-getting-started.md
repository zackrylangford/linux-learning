🧾 Bash Scripting Lesson 1: Getting Started
🎯 Goal
Learn the absolute basics of Bash scripting by writing, executing, and organizing a simple Hello World script. Set up your personal scripting environment using best practices for Linux servers and cloud environments.

🧠 What You’ll Learn
What a Bash script is
How to create and run your first script
What the shebang line does
Where to store scripts on your Linux system
How to make a script executable and callable from anywhere

🧱 Prerequisites
Any Linux terminal (AlmaLinux, Ubuntu, etc.)
Basic familiarity with the shell
A user account with access to bash and file permissions

🪛 Step-by-Step Instructions
✅ Step 1: Create a New Script
nano hello.sh

Paste the following:
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, world!"

✅ Step 2: Make the Script Executable
chmod +x hello.sh

✅ Step 3: Run the Script
./hello.sh

You should see:
Hello, world!


📂 Step 4: Organize Your Scripts (Best Practice)
Create a ~/bin directory if it doesn’t exist:
mkdir -p ~/bin

Move your script there:
mv hello.sh ~/bin/

Add ~/bin to your PATH (if not already in it):
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Now you can run your script from anywhere:
hello.sh


🔍 Key Concepts
Concept
Explanation
#!/bin/bash
The shebang tells the system to use Bash to interpret the script.
chmod +x
Makes the script executable. Without this, the OS won’t run it.
~/bin
A personal directory for user scripts that’s safe and standard.
$PATH
An environment variable that tells your shell where to look for executables. Adding ~/bin means your scripts can be run globally like normal commands.

✅ Mini-Challenge: Create Another Script
Create a greeting script:
nano ~/bin/greet.sh

Paste:
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter your name: " name
echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to AlmaLinux."

Make it executable:
chmod +x ~/bin/greet.sh

Run it:
greet.sh


🔐 Server/Cloud Notes
On servers, place scripts in:
/usr/local/bin (shared system-wide scripts)
~/bin (for per-user scripts)
Keep secrets out of scripts — use environment variables or AWS Parameter Store
Use version control for important scripts (e.g., GitHub or GitLab)

🧠 Review Questions

Why do we use chmod +x on scripts?
What is the purpose of ~/bin?
How does adding to $PATH help?
How would you safely organize automation scripts for cloud servers?
